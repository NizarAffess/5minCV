# 5minCV
***5minCV*** is a CV Builder Web App built with vanilla JS and jsPDF library. <br/>
## [Live Demo](https://5mincv.netlify.app)<br/>

Create your CV with ***5minCV*** in 5 minutes or even less. <br/>
The whole app runs and renders everything on the Front-end so you don't need to wait the server side rendering to get your copy. <br/> 
Fill in the multi-step form with your informations until you reach the end by taking a preview, download your copy or edit it by updating the form fields. <br/>
## Future plans 
The current version needs lot of improvements. The next features will be:
* Responisve layout.
* Adding a progress bar to highlight every step of the form.
* Better UI to simplify the process of filling the form by: 
  - Using a WYSIWYG Editor.
  - Adding Checkboxes and Radio buttons for some steps.
  - Possiblity to create lists. 
  - Comma seperated inputs for skills (programming languages...) and hobbies...
  - DropDwon inputs for job title and companies.
* Increase image size support up to 5MB.
* Customizable input sections. 
* Adding character counter for text fields.
* Implement Real-Time preview instead of Pop-up window. 
* Modularize the code.
* Provide more templates to choose from.
## Contribution
All of the features listed above cannot be done by one single guy in a short period of time. That's why we rely on your contributions.<br/>
We aim to keep everything rendered on the Front-end, but if you have some add-ons that requires some Back-end we may push your feedback as far as it proves its benefits. <br/> 
We are happy to see you here and we will be grateful if you suggest anything that could help improve this work. <br/>
Thanks for your support!
